Hi everyone, here is Zefan Liu. This is the repository of my homework4 for STAT545B.

In this final homework, I did two things: first I made a plot for counting the top 15 most common words in Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen after filtering out the "stopwords", and then I created a function to convert a word to my-own-style Pig Latin word. Both Rmd and md are in the repository, so feel free to explore by yourself!
